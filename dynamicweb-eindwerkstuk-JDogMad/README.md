# Math4You
Math game for kids

## Description
This project is built for the Dynamic Web examen. Math4You is a math game for kids between the age of 4 and 10 years. It contains 5 small games, where they learn their maths, using random equation generaters. Main mechanisme is the generator that generate random equations, and a set of dummy answers. Other than that I use a LocalStorage to keep the score, client_id and highscore. With the API, I want to display pictures, mimicking ad-placements. CountAPI, is an api that lets you know how many times your site has been clicked on (just a little fun extra).
